That's gonna be the problem. Also, another point where your USB comparison fails is that USB works in places where you don't have internet access. <p>My suggestion is to drop the \"Throw away your USB drive\" tag line and use something else... it will just muddy your vision.<p>Kudos for launching it!!! Launching/shipping is extremely hard and you pulled it off! Super!",
